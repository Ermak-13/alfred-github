Github Alfred extension
=======================

Disclaimer
----------

The extension is currently WIP, and I'm learning myself some python, so it's going to be ugly.

Summary
-------

This alfred extension helps you open github repos in your web browser with a few keystrokes.
Just type `gh <repo name substring>` and hit Enter.

TODO
----

- Better fuzzy matching
- Handle authentication failure
